ThoughtStream: Reviving Authentic Dialogue
ThoughtStream is a text-based social platform built for humans who are allergic to algorithmic noise, influencer marketing, and sponsored feelings. It’s for those who want conversation, not conversion funnels.

Why ThoughtStream?
Text-Based Posts
No videos. No gifs. No distractions. Just thoughts, written with intention (or at least basic grammar).

Chronological Feed
Posts appear in the order they’re made. Radical, we know.

Thematic Tagging
Organize content by meaningful themes like mutual aid, urban post-capitalist gardening, or tea blends that slap.

Interest-Driven Discovery
An algorithm that suggests content based on your preferences—not whatever topic is being milked by 30,000 bots.

What We Don’t Do
No Crypto Bros
We like coins that buy tea, not vibes.

No Pyramid Schemes
If your “business” requires luring your cousin into debt, keep walking.

No Influencer Marketing
You will not be subtly sold face cream here. Or anything, really.

What You Get
A quiet, principled corner of the internet where thoughts flow freely, people reflect (instead of “like”), and you don’t need to game the algorithm to be heard. It’s for thinkers, questioners, soft anarchists, digital hermits, and the tea-fueled curious.

Join ThoughtStream and be part of a platform where real conversations can happen again.
